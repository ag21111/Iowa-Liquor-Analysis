Note from 02.18.2026:

I worked on this project back in end of 2024 to analyze business opportunity around liquor sales in Iowa.

Built a cool shiny tool in R in one of the last scripts.

Leveraged R's renv package to ensure that the required packages are portable for anyone who wants to run the scripts.
